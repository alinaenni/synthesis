Smiling in speech synthesis

These are the nine synthesised sentences that were used for the listening experiment to determine whether 
participants could perceive differences in their smiliness. For each sentence, four levels of smiliness were
synthesised, but only three of the levels ended up being used in the study. This is because the lowest level 
(the first .wav file of each sentence) sounded too unnatural.
